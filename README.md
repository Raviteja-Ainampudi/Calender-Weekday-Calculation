# Calender-Weekday-Calculation
Given any day in any year (authenticated). It gives the weekday.  And the time frame to that particular date could be found in the Age- calculator script. Which can be found in the repository.

 #To determine the weekday of the birthday of the person
 #For this the assumption considered is that the first day of the calendar has started with SATURDAY
 The Source for this assumption is - http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-history.html

 #This Alogorith works perfectly from 14th September 1752. Because there are 11 missing in september of 1752..
 #The Calendar has been changed. From September 2nd to September  to 14th September Missing 11 days.
